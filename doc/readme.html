<h1>FinalGROM 99</h1>

<p>The <em>TI 99/4A FinalGROM Cartridge</em>, or FinalGROM 99 for short, is a
cartridge for the TI 99/4A home computer that allows you to run ROM and GROM
cartridge images from an SD card.  It succeeds the <a href="https://endlos99.github.io/flashrom99">FlashROM 99</a> released
in 2016.</p>

<p><img src="finalgrom99.jpg" alt="The FinalGROM 99 Cartridge" title="" /></p>

<p>The FinalGROM 99 supports ROM images, GROM images, and mixed images of up to
1 MB in size that use the write-to-ROM bank switching scheme.  The cartridge
does not require the Peripheral Expansion Box and runs on both PAL and NTSC
consoles, including modified consoles with an F18A.  It will also run on
v2.2 consoles and enables those to run ROM-only programs.</p>

<p>The cartridge offers some advanced modes that provide RAM and GRAM to
programs.  It also allows a running program to reload another program from
SD card or to dump its state to SD card.  All firmware of the FinalGROM 99
can be updated by SD card.</p>

<p>The FinalGROM 99 is released as Open Source Hardware under the
<a href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cernohl/wiki">CERN OHL license</a> and the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL license</a>.  Both hardware design
files and firmware sources are available on <a href="https://github.com/endlos99/finalgrom99">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The project homepage with detailed instructions is located at <a href="https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Using the FinalGROM 99</h2>

<p>Using the FinalGROM 99 is simple and doesn't require any special hardware or
software.</p>

<p>To begin, copy some cartridge dumps or other images files onto an SD or SDHC
card.  You can create directories to organize your programs.  Switch off the
TI 99 and plug in the FinalGROM 99, then insert the SD card into the
FinalGROM 99.  Switch on the TI 99 and wait until the activity indicator on
the FinalGROM 99 is no longer lit.</p>

<p>Press any key to bring up the TI menu screen.  You should see the <code>FINALGROM
99</code> entry.  Select it to start the image browser, where you can page through
the list of available image entries with <code>,</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>SPACE</code>, and number keys.
When you descend into a folder, the FinalGROM will reload its contents from
the SD card.  To go back up to the parent folder, select the special folder
<code>/ ..</code>.</p>

<p><img src="selection.png" alt="Image selection" title="" /></p>

<p>Select the image you want to run.  The screen will show a loader animation
while the image loads.  Once the image has been loaded, it will start
automatically.  The SD card is now no longer required and may be removed.</p>

<p>If only one image is found on the SD card, it is loaded immediately without
the need to select it first.  This method ensures maximum compatibility.
Note that ROM images loaded as single-image SD card will not run on v2.2
consoles!</p>

<p>If you want to run a different program from the SD card, reset the TI 99 by
pressing <code>FCTN-=</code> and then reset the FinalGROM 99 by pushing the reset
button.  If you do not reset the FinalGROM 99, the TI menu will show only
the previously selected image.  Alternatively, you can power cycle the
console, which will reset both TI 99 and FinalGROM 99.</p>

<h2>Building the FinalGROM 99</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/endlos99/finalgrom99">GitHub repository</a> contains all hardware design files and software
sources required to build the FinalGROM 99.</p>

<p>Building the FinalGROM 99 is slightly more involved than building its
predecessor <a href="https://endlos99.github.io/flashrom99">FlashROM 99</a>, as the FinalGROM 99 uses surface-mounted
devices (SMD), of which two are programmable.  For starters, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PB0u8irn-4">video tutorial</a> shows how to solder SMD ICs by hand.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>

<p>To build the FinalGROM 99, you need the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>1x FinalGROM 99 PCB</li>
<li>1x Xilinx XC95144XL-10TQ100 (TQFP-100)</li>
<li>1x Atmel ATmega 328P (TQPF-32)</li>
<li>1x Cypress SRAM CY62158ELL-45ZSXI (TSOP-44)</li>
<li>1x On Semiconductor Voltage Converter NCP1117ST33T3G (SOT-223)</li>
<li>12x 100 nF ceramic capacitors (SMD 0603)</li>
<li>2x 10 uF tantalum capacitors (SMD 0603)</li>
<li>2x 330 Ohm resistor (SMD 0603)</li>
<li>2x 10 kOhm resistor (SMD 0603)</li>
<li>1x LED 3-5 mm (through-hole)</li>
<li>2x micro push button (through-hole)</li>
<li>1x 2x3 socket (through-hole)</li>
<li>1x SD socket or Arduino SD shield</li>
</ul>

<p>The FinalGROM 99 board was designed with <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org">KiCad</a>, a cross platform and
open source electronics design automation suite.  The design files are
stored in <code>pcb/</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/endlos99/finalgrom99">repository</a>.</p>

<p>The size of the 330 Ohm resistor depends on the color and brightness of your
LED.  For bright, red LEDs, 330 Ohm is a suitable value.</p>

<p>Both LED and push buttons are through-hole components, so that they can be
mounted on a cartridge shell and connected by wires to the board.</p>

<p><img src="placement.jpg" alt="Parts Placement" title="" /></p>

<p>For the SD socket, you need a socket that has two little nubs at the bottom
of the socket.  Your best source for these is eBay, but check the pictures
before you buy.  Alternatively, you may use an Arduino SD shield that is
readily available online.  Make sure to pick a module that matches the
pin-out of the reference module shown below.  Note that the 5V input is not
used, so potential substitutes must be powered by 3.3V.</p>

<p><img src="sdsocket.jpg" alt="SD socket" title="" /></p>

<p>With some work, the FinalGROM 99 can be mounted in a standard TI 99
cartridge shell.</p>

for available options.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>The firmware for the ATmega 328P consists of two components.  The <code>avr/</code>
folder contains the microcontroller logic for accessing the SD card,
generating the image browser, loading the selected image, and controlling
the CPLD.  The included bootloader enables firmware updates from an SD card.</p>

<p>The <code>ti/</code> folder contains TI 99 assembly sources for the image browser, the
GPL wrapper, and the help viewer.  The assembled machine code is embedded in
the microcontroller and loaded into RAM during operation.</p>

<p>To build the software, first run the <code>make.py</code> script in the <code>ti</code> folder.
You will need both <code>xas99</code> and <code>xga99</code> assemblers from the <a href="https://endlos99.github.io/xdt99">xdt Suite</a> to
assemble the sources.  The script will also convert the generated machine
code into C code for the microcintroller.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ti/
$ ./make.py
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to compile the microcontroller and bootloader code in
<code>avr/</code>.  The included <code>Makefile</code>s make the compilation trivial:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd avr/
$ make
$ cd boot/
$ make
</code></pre>

<p>The last build yields a <code>package.hex</code> file containing both machine code
and bootloader.  You can flash the file to the ATmega 328P using
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/"><code>avrdude</code></a> or any other programmer:</p>

<pre><code>$ avrdude -p m328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c stk500 -U flash:w:package.hex
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, you need to program the lower fuse bits of the 328P so that it
runs at 8 Mhz:</p>

<pre><code>$ avrdude -p m328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c stk500 -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using a different tool chain make sure to set <code>CKSEL3..0</code> in the
lower fuse byte to <code>0100</code>.  (Note that <code>0</code> means "programmed"/checked, and
<code>1</code> means "unprogrammed"/unchecked).</p>

<p>You can verify that you're running at the right clock speed by resetting
the FinalGROM 99 with no SD card inserted: The LED should blink about once
per second.</p>

<p>For future updates, you may copy the file <code>UPDATE.AVR</code> generated by the
first make in <code>avr/</code> to an SD card and start the FinalGROM 99 with it.  This
procedure will update the microcontroller similar to <code>avrdude</code>, but it does
not touch the bootloader.</p>

<p>Programming the CPLD requires the Xilinx <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite/ise-webpack.html">ISE 14.7 Web Pack</a> to generate
a JEDEC file or an XSVF file.  ISE Web Pack is freely available for Windows
and Linux.  After the installation, open ISE and open the project in
<code>vhdl/</code>.  Click on the little green arrow next to the process window to
generate a JEDED file.</p>

<p>The microcontroller contains an XSVF player to program the CPLD without JTAG
cable.  Generate the necessary XSVF file from the JEDED file by running (you
may have to adjust the path in <code>impact-batch</code>)</p>

<pre><code>$ cd vhdl/src
$ ./impact-batch fg99-xsvf
</code></pre>

<p>Copy the resulting <code>.XSVF</code> file as <code>UPDATE.PLD</code> to an SD card and start the
FinalGROM 99 with it.  The cart will program the CPLD just like a JTAG cable
would do.</p>

<p>Once microcontroller and CPLD have been programmed, the assembled FinalGROM
99 is ready to use.</p>
